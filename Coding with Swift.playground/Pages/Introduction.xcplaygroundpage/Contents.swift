 # Introduction to the Swift language
 
 ## Before we start
 
 - Enable rendered markup by the top menu of the Xcode app: `Editor > Show Rendered Markup`  

 - Some lines are commented with "//" as the prefix of the line. Some of them are some invalid code syntax
   or code cannot be executed. You can try to uncomment the line (by removing the "//" prefix) to 
   see what would happen and observe the error code. (The shortcut key is "Command + /")
 
 - The execution result would be displayed after the line. You can click the "white dot" to make the 
   result larget to see.
